## Introduction

Welcome to the Capital Budgeting Model in Excel with @Risk repository! This repository contains an Excel spreadsheet enhanced with the @Risk software plugin, which is used to perform probabilistic analysis. The spreadsheet includes two sheets, "static" and "stochastic," designed to help you evaluate and analyze potential capital investment projects with the added benefit of risk assessment.

## Features

- **@Risk Integration**: The Excel spreadsheet is integrated with the @Risk software, allowing for probabilistic modeling and analysis. You can simulate different scenarios and assess project risks.

- **Multiple Sheets**: The spreadsheet contains two sheets:
  1. **Static Sheet**: Use this sheet for traditional deterministic analysis. Input project details, financial information, and assumptions to evaluate project feasibility.
  
  2. **Stochastic Sheet**: In this sheet, leverage the power of @Risk to perform Monte Carlo simulations and assess the impact of uncertainty on your capital investment decisions.

- **NPV, IRR, and Risk Analysis**: The model calculates key financial metrics such as Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and incorporates risk analysis to provide a more comprehensive view of project viability.

- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Perform sensitivity analysis on the stochastic sheet by running simulations with different variables to understand how uncertainties affect project outcomes.

- **Graphical Representation**: Visualize project cash flows, risk distributions, and metrics through graphs and charts for more informed decision-making.

## Usage

This Capital Budgeting Model in Excel with @Risk is designed for educational and informational purposes. It is a powerful tool for understanding how uncertainties impact capital budgeting decisions. Always consult with financial experts and consider specific business circumstances when making final investment decisions.
